# Biography

I am an undergraduate student at [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi](iiitd.ac.in), studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.  

I am always looking to learn more about topics in Computer Science. I enjoy 
working on multi-disciplinary projects and I am always looking to build collaborations 
with new people from different disciplines.

Currently, I am a part of [Laboratory of Computational Social Systems](lcs2.iiitd.edu.in) at
IIIT Delhi. I have been working on detecting collusive activities in online social networks.

_I love reading science fiction, Ruskin Bond, and the company of friendly canines._
