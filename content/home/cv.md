I am a Third-year undergraduate student at IIIT Delhi. My research interests are in Deep
Learning and its applications in different disciplines, from Linguistics to Online Social
Networks to Neuroscience.

I dabbled with software development in my freshman year, and interned at _[Microsoft IGD](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/about-microsoft/our-offices-msgd.aspx)_. But by my second year I got interested in Deep Learning and Data Science and moved on to do research projects in these fields. I have had the chance to work with mentors from _[IBM India Research Laboratory](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/)_. 

Currently, I am a part of _[Laboratory of Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](lcs2.iiitd.edu.in)_, headed by __[Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://sites.google.com/site/tanmoychakra88/)__ at IIIT Delhi.
